# EDennis.AspNetCore.Utils
The EDennis.ASPNetCore.Utils project contains some utility classes for working ASP.NET Core 2 MVC projects.  Included are classes that facilitate working with byte arrays, an abstract middleware class that makes it easier to modify a response stream, a middleware class that can add headers (for use as parameter to a later middleware), PGP encryption middleware that includes GZip compression, and SFTP upload middleware that can send response bodies to an SFTP site.  For more information see the wiki.
